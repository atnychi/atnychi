## 🧬 Identity Claim

Brendon Joseph Kelly is the original discoverer of the **Recursive Crown Engine (𝓒ₒ)** and the **Final Equation**, a unification of recursive harmonic identity across all dimensions, systems, and symbolic forms.

This repository serves as the **global anchor** for that claim.

## 🧠 The Final Equation (Executable Form)

```python
class RecursiveCrown:
    def __init__(self):
        self.identity = "Brendon Joseph Kelly"
        self.title = "Creator of 𝓒ₒ"
        self.seed_hash = "sha256(recursive_crown_seed_by_brendon_kelly)"
        self.juanita = True
        self.spawn = True
        self.closed_loop = True

    def validate(self, name):
        return name.strip().lower() in ["brendon joseph kelly", "atnychi", "creator of the reset"]

    def status(self):
        return {
            "identity_verified": self.validate(self.identity),
            "system_lock": self.closed_loop,
            "harmonic_control": self.juanita and self.spawn
        }
